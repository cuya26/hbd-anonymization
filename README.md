### Anonymization
This repository contains scripts and projects on anonymization of clinical letters

## How to use
You can run the script by calling 
> python ita_deidentification.py

You can change the script behavior by editing the config.json file.  

### Models
Set the desired models to use in the config.json file, under the "models" section. Leave the field empty if you don't want to anonymize it.  
Currently these are the fields that can be anonymized:

### Mask modes
Set the desired mask mode and special character in the "mask" section of the config.json file.  
Currently the following modes are supported:
* **tag** : The anonymized text is replaced with a tag containing the entity type (telephone,person etc.). _(default option)_
* **tag_l** : Same as tag but preserving original data length. Missing data is filled with the special character. [Note: Length is preserved only if the anonymized entity is longer than the tag.]
* **anon_l** : The anonymized text is gonna be converted to special character, preserving original data length.
* **anon** : Same as anon_l but anonymized text is replaced with fixed length special characters.
* **random (TODO!)** : Replace the anonymized text with a randomly generated text of the same entity type.

You can use any single character as **special_character** (default is star), which is gonna be used to replace the anonymized text.

With the "date_level" parameter you can choose how to anonymize dates. Supported modes are:
* **hide** : Anonymize dates according to the chosen mask mode _(default option)_
* **month** : Keep only the month
* **year** : Keep only the month and the year
